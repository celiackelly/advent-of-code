/*
 The total size of a directory is the sum of the sizes of the files it contains, directly or indirectly. 

 To begin, find all of the directories with a total size of at most 100000, then calculate the sum of their total sizes. In the example above, these directories are a and e; the sum of their total sizes is 95437 (94853 + 584). (As in this example, this process can count files more than once!)

Determine the total size of each directory.

Find all of the directories with a total size of at most 100000. What is the sum of the total sizes of those directories?

//start by mapping the file system? 

//every time we reach a dir, we need to get its total file size and add it to our array 

//then filter the array for values >= 100000, and reduce to find their sum
